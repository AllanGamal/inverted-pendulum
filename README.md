An attempt to balance an inverted pendulum using a neural network generated with a genetic algorithm.

  <h2>Inverted Pendulum Project</h2>
  <p>This project aims to balance an inverted pendulum using a neural network generated with a genetic algorithm. The project is written in Python, and it simulates the motion of the pendulum using the pygame library.</p>


   <h2>Goals going into the project</h3>
   <p>The goals of the project includes:</p>
   
 <ul>
        <li>Implementing a genetic algorithm to generate a neural network capable of balancing the pendulum</li>
        <li>Displaying real-time data about the simulation on the screen.</li>
        <li>Optimizing the simulation's performance for smooth and stable motion.</li>
 </ul>
    

  <h2>Recognizing some potential issues</h2>
  <p> Potential issues that could arise during development include: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Designing the pendulum simulation and the genetic algorithm.</li>
        <li>Implementing the graphical display using the pygame library.</li>
        <li>Optimizing and fine-tuning the genetic algorithm for better results</li>
</ul>

   <h3>Basic setup of the inverted pendulum "game"</h3>
   
   <p>Basic setup for the game, added functionality to display real time input and output (and normalized) in the game window too like:
   <ul>
        <li>Base x-position.</li>
        <li>Base speed</li>
        <li>Pendulum angle</li>
        <li>Pendulum angular velocity</li>
        <li>Input Data: Left and right key</li>
</ul>
   Now when typing this I realize that I might need pendulum acceleration as well, but im going to tro without it at first. You can move the base with the left/right arrow to affect the pendulum.</p>
